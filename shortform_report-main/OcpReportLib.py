"""
A simple library for generating the short-form vendor security review report.

This script is intended to be used by Security Review Providers who are
participating in the Open Compute Project's Firmware Security Review Framework.
The script complies with version 0.3 (draft) of the Security Review Framework
document.

More details about the OCP review framework can be found here:
*  https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Security

For example usage of this script, refer to the following:
  * example_generate.py: 
      Demonstrates how to generate, sign and verify the JSON report.
  * sample_report.json
      An example JSON report that was created by this script.
