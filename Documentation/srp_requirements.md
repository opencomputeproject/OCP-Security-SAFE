* DV - Device Vendor
* SRP - Security Review Provider

## Executive Summary

This document gives guidelines for the selection of external SRP organizations to do security assessments of software
and firmware designs and implementations, and hardware designs, particularly for trusted applications. It defines scopes
of assessment aligned with products and industry practice, then gives the technical expertise and capabilities the SRP
organization needs to deliver quality assessments covering those scopes. There are also general organizational
requirements intended to ensure such assessments are broadly trusted. These guidelines are intended to make it easier
for DVs and CSPs to engage with SRP organizations to get quality, relevant, trusted third party assessments.

This document describes guidelines for both scope of assessments relative to device types under assessment and to the
requirements on the SRP in order to prove capability to deliver quality assessments matching the scopes defined.

Different scope levels will encompass varying device types subject to different security threats. Some scopes have
narrower requirements and correspond to relatively common device types and review scenarios, while others require
demonstrating a larger, different set of skills to deliver an assessment.

It will likely be the case that a single SOC may require analysis from multiple scopes, e.g. the security processor may
require additional scrutiny than the application cores.

![alt_text](images/growing_scope.png "image_tooltip")

There is a burden of proof on the SRP to demonstrate it meets the guidelines. The OCP will establish a panel for
assessing applications to become an approved SRP, and this document gives the basis on which the assessment will be
made. The application should include a response to the business requirements and technical requirements given below. The
response to the technical requirements should be organized around the assessment scopes. A more comprehensive list of
review areas can be found in the [review areas](review_areas.md) document.

## Assessment Scope Overview

![alt_text](images/safe_focus_areas.png "image_tooltip")

### Scope 1 - Validating Code

#### Discussion

This scope broadly covers privileged software and firmware in the context of a single device or function. Areas of
emphasis include evaluating code quality and development practices as well as correct application of standards and
interaction with security hardware.

#### Examples

Device drivers and privileged software interacting with existing approved hardware or IP, firmware for a single endpoint
device handling only its identity and ephemeral secrets,

#### Desired Capabilities

The SRP should be prepared to offer assessment capabilities in the following areas.

1. Review of existing or preparation of new threat model
2. Review of documentation
3. Review of evidence
4. Code Review
    1. Firmware authenticity and integrity
    2. Secure boot
    3. Update mechanisms
    4. Short term secrets
    5. Credentials
    6. Cryptography
        1. Material handling
        2. Algorithms
        3. Entropy sources
    7. Input validation
    8. Backdoors
    9. Typical development errors
    10. Use of deprecated or insecure functions
    11. Memory safe programming
    12. Dependencies
    13. Erasure
    14. Exploit mitigation
5. Review of build environment
    1. Review of toolchain integrity:

    * Specified compiler, library versions

    2. Review of toolchain output

    * Use of protective technology
    * Debug strings, symbols
    * Stack canaries, protection

### Scope 2 - Assessing architecture for isolation

#### Discussion

This scope focuses on Trusted Execution Environments and trust boundaries with designs operating with the least
privilege, generally speaking in a context with multiple trust boundaries or multiple physical devices. Examples include
devices that include or heavily use root of trust and security processors for SOC management, and host capabilities such
as SGX, SEV, or Trustzone for user or application isolation and protection.

#### Examples

Accelerator hardware intended to serve multiple customer tenants simultaneously.

#### Required Capabilities

1. Trusted Execution Environment assessment
2. Handling of trust boundaries
3. Attestation and non-repudiation across boundaries
4. Physical and logical debug paths evaluation
5. RTL/ROM evaluation

### Scope 3 - Assessing system for resilience to physical attacks

#### Discussion

This scope is intended to cover devices and systems that require assessing their resilience to physical attack. Parts of
an SOC that may require this level of analysis include root of trust, security processor, logic handling long term
secrets, and crypto accelerator blocks.

#### Required Capabilities

1. Threat model evaluation vs design mitigations
    1. Demonstrated expertise with current attack techniques and costs in time and equipment
    2. Demonstrated expertise with mitigation techniques
2. Design evaluation for physical isolation
   1. Specific evaluation of software coding techniques (time, CFI)
   2. RTL evaluation (masking, clocking, toolchain capabilities, â€¦)
   3. Physical design evaluation for isolation, die and PCB
3. Time, Frequency, Voltage, Power, Optical and EM domain side channel analysis facilities
4. Time, Voltage, Optical and EM domain fault injection facilities
5. Code flow integrity protections around boot and crypto
   1. Time constant
   2. Checking complimentary hw
   3. Integrity checked OTP fuses
6. Crypto accelerators designed to withstand glitching attacks
