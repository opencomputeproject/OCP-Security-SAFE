# Assessment Scope

This section provides guidance for the areas expected to be assessed by an SRP. The list is purposefully vague because
the OCP Workgroup believes that high quality, timely assessments are best achieved by letting the SRPs focus on the
architectural and implementation areas that are commonly known to have gaps or deficiencies in the scenario under
review.

1. Secrets and storage must support secure erasure and reset
2. HW ROT key store must support secure erasure
3. Debug interfaces can only be re-enabled on entire secure erasure of DUT or with appropriate cryptographic
   challenge/response mechanism

1. Secure logging and telemetry
2. Configurable logging to support security events
3. Cryptographic tamper detectable logs

#### Debug

1. Debugging mode must be disabled by default
2. Debug and test code should not be present in production DUT
3. Debug interfaces can only be re-enabled on entire secure erasure of DUT or with appropriate cryptographic
   challenge/response mechanism
4. If debugging functionality can be re-enabled, it must not provide any sensitive information
5. If enabled, debug should be disabled automatically on idle timeout or reboot
6. If re-enabled, debug interfaces and functionality must not compromise DUT security posture, secrets or claims

#### Secure management

1. Cryptographically appropriate authentication required for management functions
2. Management functions must operate under the principle of least privilege
3. Cryptographically appropriate transport layer for management functions, e.g. TLS

#### Dependencies

1. Third party software/firmware components including version specifics recorded in SBOM
2. Configuration specifics for third party dependencies recorded in SBOM
3. Third party dependencies up to date
4. Third party dependencies version pinned and in change control

#### Hardening

1. Interfaces must enforce authentication and authorization specific to the interface
2. Security sensitive operations restricted to trusted interfaces
3. Ability to disable all functionality, APIâ€™s, services not required for deployment

#### Trusted Execution Environment

1. DV implemented TEE's must generally conform to standards evolving in the Confidential Computing Consortium.
2. Trusted execution environment has physical and logical safeguards to provide isolation from other processing entities
3. IO from the TEE follows industry standards such as IDE or TDISP. If a proprietary protocol is used, e.g. XGMI,
   NVLINK, it must provide similar authentication, integrity, and isolation guarantees

#### Root of Trust

1. HW ROT shall be both through design and implementation appropriately isolated and protected from application and
   control processes.
2. The HW ROT shall measure and endorse boot and runtime code
3. If the HW ROT supports bulk cryptographic engines, the HW ROT must support secure key transport to and from the bulk
   cryptographic engine

5. The HW ROT shall implement cryptographically secure tamper resistant logs
6. The HW ROT shall be appropriately cryptographically bound to DUT

#### Identity

4. DUT version must be reproducible from SBOM

#### Volatile and non-volatile storage

1. Encrypted memory or storage uses industry standard crypto e.g., AES-XTS
2. Encryption keys must be generated to appropriate length and entropy to comply with FIPS/CNSA standards
3. Encryption keys must not be stored/cache in associated volatile or non-volatile storage
4. Wrapped keys, typically used for storage or transport, must have a mechanism to detect modification or replay
5. Encryption mechanisms are resistant to side channel attacks
